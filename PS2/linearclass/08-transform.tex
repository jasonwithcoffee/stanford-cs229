\item \subquestionpointswritten{1} For the dataset where GDA performed worse in parts (f) and (g), can you find a transformation of the $x^{(i)}$'s such that GDA performs significantly better? What might this transformation be?\\[50pt]

\hl{In dataset 1, x2 seems to have an exponential characteristic. We can apply a transformation to $x^{(i)}$'s such that GDA performs significantly better. The transformation is to apply $\log()$ to x2 in dataset 1.}
