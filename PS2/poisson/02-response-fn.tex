\item \subquestionpointswritten{1} Consider performing regression using a GLM model with a Poisson response variable.  What is the canonical response function for the family?  (You may use the fact that a Poisson random variable with parameter $\lambda$ has mean $\lambda$.)\\[20pt]


\begin{flalign*}
  \mathbb{E}[T(y); \eta] &= \mathbb{E}[y; \eta]  \\
  \mathbb{E}[y; \eta] &= \lambda \\
  &= e^\eta
